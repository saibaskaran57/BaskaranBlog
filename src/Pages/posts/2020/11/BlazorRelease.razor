        Microsoft have announced the release of .NET 5 which it's globally available. I'm pretty excited on what
        .NET 5 can bring improvements to the .NET ecosystem and to my blog. Worthy of a upgrade to .NET 5? Let's
        see!
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>In closing</h4>
        There are several benefits on .NET 5 which ultimately grows Blazor technology. I'm impressed on the efforts on Blazor
        WebAssembly technology which will eventually be a norm. It seems to me that the focus was ultimately on improving performance,
        my future post will definitely review on the underlying functionality & metrics as well. Till then, good luck with the .NET 5
        upgrade.
